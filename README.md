# **nenupy**
*nenupy* is a Python package, written by A. Loh (LESIA, Obs. Paris), in order to handle *NenuFAR* observations.
[*NenuFAR*](https://nenufar.obs-nancay.fr) is a low-frequency radiotelescope located in Nancay, France.

## Installation
### pip
To install *nenupy* with pip:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nenupy
```
If `nenupy` is already install, the newer version can be installed:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nenupy --upgrade
```

## Access and plot Statistics data
Loading the environment, within python3:
```python
from nenupy3.read import SST, BST, XST
```
`SST`, `BST` and `XST` are three separate modules to read **Sub-band Statistics**, **Beamlet Statistics** and **Cross-correlation Statistics** data respectively.

Once a reading module is loaded, a *NenuFAR* observation can be read, here is an example of a **BST** observation:
```python
bst_obs = BST('some_observation_BST.fits')
```
`bst_obs` is now an *instance* of the `BST` class. It means it contains attributes that have been filled with the observation properties as well as some methods/functions to access and plot the data.

Data selection is granted by the `getData()` method, which accepts keywords such as `freq`, `polar` and `time`:
```python
bst_obs.getData( freq=[20, 60], time='2018-09-01 10:00:00.0', polar='nw' )
```

Once the function `getData()` has been called, the data are stored in the `d` attribute (`t`, `f` for time and frequency as well). The user can then use these variable to do some specific analysis or to plot the data using the generic `matplotlib` module:
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot( bst_obs.t.mjd, bst_obs.d )
plt.show()
```
Otherwise, the `plotData()` method could also be used:
```python
bst_obs.plotData()
```

## Beam simulation

### SST beam / Mini-Array gain
**SST** beams are computed through a separate module called `SSTbeam`.
```python
from nenupy3.beam import SSTbeam
sst = SSTbeam()
```
The object `sst` would then correspond to default Mini-Array number 0.
A query could be more specific, for example:
```python
from nenupy3.beam import SSTbeam
sst = SSTbeam(ma=21, freq=46, polar='NE', azana=175., elana=72.)
sst.plotBeam() # will show the simulated beam
```
